# Code Review Guideline

> Review like a true bro, no hate just love :heart:

## Overview

These guidelines stem from what code review should accomplish. Here's a list of few pointers on what
our code reviews should achieve.

* Verify that the code is correct and effective solution for the requirements at hand
* Ensure that the code is maintainable
* Increase shared knowledge of the codebase
* Sharpen the team's skills through regular feedback and discussions

#### Review

* Check and read the purpose of the **Pull Request**
* Look for the overview and description. See if the author provided relevant links or screenshots
* Always check what the author needs on his request, look for explicit labels and hints
* Check if the author is already done or still in progress
* @mention other individuals from the team to involve with the review

#### Offering Feedback

* Familiarize yourself with the context of the issue, and reasons why this **PR** exists
* If you want to disagree strongly, consider giving it a few minutes or moment before responding,
  **think before you act**
* Ask, don't tell. ("What about considering this.." rather than "Don't do this...")
* Elaborate on why the code should be changed
* **Always** offer ways to simplify or improve code effectively. Avoid bias
* Be humble, avoid using deragotory terms. No one's perfect
* You can use emojis to clarify tone and intent
* Lastly, aim to develop professional skills, group knowledge and product quality, through group critique

#### Responding to Feedback

* Consider leading with an expression of appreciation, especially when feedback has been mixed
* Ask for clarification when not sure
* Also, offer clarification when not clear. Explain the decisions you made to reach a solution
* Try to respond to every comment or query
* Link to any follow up commits or PRs ("Nice call! Done in #235112")
* If there is a growing confusion or debate, ask yourself if the written word is still the best
  form of communication
